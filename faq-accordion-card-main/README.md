## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animation
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- Javascript Events



### What I learned

This project was my first success at making an interactive webpage with click events!
I learned how to traverse through the DOM, select elements through Javascript, and use Event Listeners.

I also successfully incorporated my first CSS animations, and learned how to have those animations respond to the Event Listeners. This was the toughest part, It took me a long time to figure out how to make the animations work on the second click. Learning .toggle() was a game changer! 

### Continued development

I struggled in this project to keep my CSS organized and concise. I found myself changing properties sporadically which led to lots of confusion, so I hope to plan more before I start coding and to refine it to be more uniform.

I also used Flexbox, but not sure if that was neccessary for the simplicity of the project. Didn't hurt to practice though.
